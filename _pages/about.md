I'm a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu) (UCR). I used to be an Assistant Project Scientist and a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Research and Education in Cyber Security and Privacy](https://cresp.cs.ucr.edu) (CRESP) at UCR led by Prof. [Heng Yin](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~heng). I obtained my Ph.D. from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. Xiaohong Guan in 2015. My research interests include Software Security, Software Engineering, and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning theories to analyzing software systems.
